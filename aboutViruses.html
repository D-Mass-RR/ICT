				A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host
				to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same
				way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer
				viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file
				or document. In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of
				malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates
				and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates
				by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document
				that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a
				virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as
				harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.

			<h2>How does a computer virus attack?</h2>
			<span
				>Once a virus has successfully attached to a program, file, or document,
				the virus will lie dormant until circumstances cause the computer or
				device to execute its code. In order for a virus to infect your
				computer, you have to run the infected program, which in turn causes the
				virus code to be executed. This means that a virus can remain dormant on
				your computer, without showing major signs or symptoms. However, once
				the virus infects your computer, the virus can infect other computers on
				the same network. Stealing passwords or data, logging keystrokes,
				corrupting files, spamming your email contacts, and even taking over
				your machine are just some of the devastating and irritating things a
				virus can do. While some viruses can be playful in intent and effect,
				others can have profound and damaging effects. This includes erasing
				data or causing permanent damage to your hard disk. Worse yet, some
				viruses are designed with financial gains in mind.</span

			<h2>How do computer viruses spread?</h2>
			<span>
				In a constantly connected world, you can contract a computer virus in
				many ways, some more obvious than others. Viruses can be spread through
				email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, and social
				media scam links. Your mobile devices and smartphones can become
				infected with mobile viruses through shady app downloads. Viruses can
				hide disguised as attachments of socially shareable content such as
				funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files. To avoid contact
				with a virus, it’s important to exercise caution when surfing the web,
				downloading files, and opening links or attachments. To help stay safe,
				never download text or email attachments that you’re not expecting, or
				files from websites you don’t trust.
